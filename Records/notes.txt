All tests are performed 5 times
Terms:
  CPT - client preprocessing (encryption) time
  TPDT - TOTAL proxy decryption time (for all proxies on the path)
  RTT - round-trip communication time

Point of Delay:
1. Communication time (delay)
2. Receival time (message length)
3. Decryption time

!!!!NOTE THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME UNIT!!!!

BASELINE 1: Direct Communication, no Proxy
BASELINE 2: One proxy, no additional encryption
BASELINE 3: Multiple proxy, no additional encryption
PODOH

Note: BASELINE 2 is the same as the first entry in BASELINE 3
